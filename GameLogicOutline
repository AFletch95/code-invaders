Starting point
___________________

Need to add in a main page and a game page. 

Need to have a start and load function on the main page. - Two buttons for that load function

Then need to create an objec for the bombs or whichever to display the word and check the entered typing for the displayed words. 

Create a  grid in which the objects and enemies populate. 

Need to pull the names for the ships/enemies from an array of pre-defined terms, or from some api library. 

Enemies need to be animated to move from one end of the screen to the other, once hitting a certain point (add collistion to a ground level element.) 
player takes damage and loses a life. 

Add more levels where the speed/strength/difficulty of those words increases and the game gets harder. 


--------------------

Once these are done, need to add the following features. 

*Power-ups, decrease the enemy speed/Destroy enemies/Freeze time. 

*Lives player needs to have a set of lives and once depleted the game is over and player must restart the level. 


*Create a save state at the end of the level. 

*Bullet tracking, make a new animated object that will track from the player sprite to the enemy sprite and delete that object. 

*Export the player data to a database. 

First functions: 

Get the game logic working once the game is in a working state start adding features such as saves, powerups, etc. 

Implement the array of words into the enemies.
